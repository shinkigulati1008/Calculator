# Calculator

This is a simple web-based calculator application. It features a sleek design with a black background, mustard yellow operator buttons, and a responsive layout.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the buttons to input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
3. The result will be displayed in the input field.
4. Press 'C' to clear the input field.
5. Press '=' to calculate and display the result.

## Styling

The calculator is styled with a modern and clean design, resembling the iPhone calculator's aesthetics. You can customize the colors and styles further by modifying the CSS in the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the `index.html` file.

Feel free to explore and enhance the functionality based on your preferences.

## Notes

- The calculator uses JavaScript's `eval()` function for basic arithmetic operations. Keep in mind that using `eval()` can have security implications, and this calculator is intended for educational and personal use.
- The calculator is designed for simplicity and may not cover all edge cases or advanced features.


**Enjoy calculating!**
